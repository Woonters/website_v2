# woonters_site_v2

The basis behind my website :)
This is mostly a test of Ratzilla and Rust WASM stuff, not always going to be the best, but should be good for some personal learning if nothing else.

Current goal is to clean up the code and make it as easy to quickly write blog posts as well as add random functionalities that actually interest me
